# shipRoutesPreview

Based on frontend dev test from here https://github.com/Marcura/frontend-developer-test/
As you can see, the application make use of Nx workspace with standalone application approach.
During the development, I focused mostly on decoupling business logic from the chart & map libraries using adapter pattern.
Also, I introduced a split into ui / feature / data-access layers to achieve a clear architecture.
Libraries are placed flatly in the src folder, but if there would be multiple separate domains in the app I'd group the libraries by domain first.
Of course the nx monorepo requires more setup to take advantage of the full potential (like introducing scope & type boundaries, enforcing rules, etc.), but I skipped this part for the purpose of this test.
For testing, I used Jest with Spectator, but I didn't write many tests because of the time constraints, I also skipped e2e tests.

## Project Description

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve ship-routes-preview` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build ship-routes-preview` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
